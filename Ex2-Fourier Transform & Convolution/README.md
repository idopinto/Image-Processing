# Fourier Transform & Convolution
## Exercise 2 | Image Processing @ HUJI

### Goals
Understanding the concept of the frequency domain by performing
simple manipulations on sounds and images. 

### This exercise covers
• Implementing Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) on 1D and 2D signals
• Performing sound fast forward
• Performing image derivative
